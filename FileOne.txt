There is only a becoming magic\
Through reaching out and through being social\
Through news of life: positive and tragic\
Sometimes people are calm other times they maul\

Will it be a waste of time, i wonder...\
I have a birds eye sight on my own view\
I have ambition, past filled with blunder\
Perhaps i just don't care why, thank you!\

Who am I? only standing in your way
This sine is my circle of life, THE BEST!
Words on a page now how will i portray 
Gotta find a life cause life ain't just BLESSED!

We must build together in dark times
But i care so little of the normal\
Oil is spilt and they cover their crimes
You are beautiful, magic, not formal.\
