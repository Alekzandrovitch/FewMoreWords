# Random-Quatrains-Sonnet-Generator

It would be nice to analyse the words and come up with a sutible couplet for the end.

Input
Takes 3 or more to just display in different order, the more you have the more it will mix them up as it has a larger amount of data to work with. 

Input file is called data.txt

Example Output 

In life there is a truth and a fiction
Will it be a waste of money, perhaps.
Truth can cause aggression with conviction
Given the chance, i will likely collapse

How can I be so unempathetic 
I have a birds eye sight on my own view
My compassion to me is pathetic 
Perhaps i just don't care why, thank you!

Compassion is a misery itself
Knowledge of all things, is out of my reach
Tring to be empathic, myself
Wandering, alone, this i cannot teach

Perhaps a basis for machine learning.
My program will have a passion burning

The couplet was created by myself still need to figure out a way to sum up 12 lines in 10 sylbals per line.
Making some sort of AI that has a map of a dictionary and a rhyme dictionary as well. I suppose it would have to analyse all the words in the sonnet find a similar meaning and create a rhyme at the end.
